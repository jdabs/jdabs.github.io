## What is BRC-20 Tokens?

BRC-20 tokens are an experimental technology on the Bitcoin blockchain. It inscribes JSON data to the blockchain, which manages the state of the tokens. The JSON data
controls the contract behind the token, minting, and transferring. The main protocol running the experiment is 
[Ordinal Inscriptions](https://research.aimultiple.com/ordinal-inscriptions/tions), which is the concept of applying metadata to the Bitcoin blockchain; in the case
of BRC-20 tokens, this is JSON metadata.

## Unisat Wallet
Unisat wallet is a browser extension that takes care of the management of your BRC-20 tokens, such as your balance, minting, and transferring tokens in 
your balance. It does this without running a full node (downloading the entire Bitcoin blockchain), which early implementations of Ordinals required. 

The wallet also has a companion website, https://unisat.io, which syncs with the wallet. The website acts as a GUI interface where you can create new tokens, 
mint existing tokens, or engage in a marketplace where you can buy and sell tokens.
