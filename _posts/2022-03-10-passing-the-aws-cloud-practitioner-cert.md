# Pass that AWS Test!

**The AWS Cloud Certification Is Easy**

The nicest part is that Amazon Web Services already has a tutorial video course that **actually** covers everything
in the test. That makes it easy.

Throw in a site that has some practice questions, and then you'll be ready.

## 1. Create an AWS account

Get to know the console and main apps by making an account at [https://aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com)

Note you don't need to go too in depth. It's nice to have on hand while you go through the video tutorials so that
you can see exactly what they're talking about.

## 2. Sign up for the Skills Builder tutorial

Next, go to [https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn)

Sign up for the course called "AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials"

Spend a few hours to go through the video tutorials and complete the quiz
at the end of each one. This is the way to cover all the materials that the
exam test will go over.

Keep the AWS console open so that you can vist each topic the videos cover
such as EC2, MongoDB, etc.

## 3. Take a practice test

Some practice tests include some on the AWS site, such as:
[https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-cloud-practitioner/AWS-Certified-Cloud-Practitioner_Sample-Questions.pdf](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-cloud-practitioner/AWS-Certified-Cloud-Practitioner_Sample-Questions.pdf)

Another is a cool practice test where you can see others discuss the validity of the answers:

Once you get most questions write, sign up to take the exam. Really, these steps don't need to take much longer
than a week!
