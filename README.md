## Going 100% open source 2021

How to do it.

Desktop OS:  
Fedora Workstaion (https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/)  
  Pros: Easy install  
        works  
        compatible with a lot of architechure 
        
Image Editing  
Gimp (https://www.gimp.org/)  
	Pros: Not $20/month
	
Smart Phone  
GrapheneOS (https://grapheneos.org/)  
Note: De-googling is somewhat hard. I have to use a separate beater Android phone with wifi-only as needed, which is rarer as I find workarounds. Not everything needs an app. Use the website instead.
